"""
Primust Connectors — Fit validation tests.

All 13 connectors must pass the three-property filter:
  1. Regulated process (has regulatory_hooks)
  2. External verifier with trust deficit
  3. Data that can't be disclosed

Note: FICO Falcon and Pega CDH pass 3/3 but have PARTIAL fit declarations.
Passing the filter means the properties exist; the fit_declared field
preserves the honest governance value assessment.
