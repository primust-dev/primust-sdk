Primust Connector: FICO Falcon Fraud Detection
===============================================
Fit: PARTIAL — honest assessment
Verifier: OCC, Fed examiners, card network compliance (Visa/MC fraud program requirements)
Problem solved: Prove fraud scoring ran on every transaction without disclosing
               the score threshold that triggers a decline or review
Proof ceiling:
  - Score computation: Attestation permanently (Falcon neural net is proprietary)
  - Threshold comparison (score >= decline_threshold): Mathematical
  - Per-stage breakdown surfaces the mathematical threshold stage to verifier
Overall VPEC: Attestation (weakest-link), but Mathematical threshold stage
             is explicitly visible in the breakdown
Buildable: NOW — Python SDK + REST

Honest fit note:
  The fraud paradox: prove the score was compared against the threshold without
  revealing the threshold (revealing enables gaming). The threshold check IS
  Mathematical — arithmetic comparison. The score computation is Attestation.
  This is genuinely useful for card network compliance audits and OCC exam prep.
  It's not as clean as the AML story because card fraud is primarily internal
  risk management, not regulated-proof-to-external-verifier. The OCC exam is
  the strongest external verifier case.

FICO Platform REST API (FICO Falcon 6.x+):
  POST /falcon/v1/score  — score a transaction
  POST /falcon/v1/batch  — batch scoring

On-premise deployments also expose:
  Java API (com.fico.falcon.FalconEngine) — for in-process Mathematical proof
  post Java SDK (P10-D). Same pattern as Blaze.

    OCC exam use case:
      Examiner asks: "Prove your fraud detection ran on all transactions in Q3."
      VPEC proves monitoring ran on each transaction without disclosing thresholds.
      Cross-run consistency scan detects inconsistent threshold application across
      identical transaction patterns — regulatory evidence of consistent controls.

    Card network compliance:
      Visa/MC fraud program requirements: demonstrate controls are active.
      VPEC provides portable proof of control operation without disclosing
      the fraud strategy that enables gaming.
